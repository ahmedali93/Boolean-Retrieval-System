##Whatchya gonna do?
Well, the task is simple..
* Build an inverted index creator - mostly done
* Build a search function (well, duh...) that uses the index and user query to satisfy the query
* Provide a GUI frontend to the search feature (using Tkinter)

##Why you doin it?

>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

If by Rudyard Kipling. 

There are days when I feel too low to do anything and doubts start arising about my abilities. In those times, its nice to have something to turn to. Something which you can devote your time to and not worry about deadlines, other contributors, coding standards .etc. That something is this project for me.

Having said that, I intend this to be a peace of beauty. Taking software architecture with utmost seriousness and No Hacks! *none* End of Story. It should be simple yet powerful. I hope to gain a lot from this

##Contributions
Any and all contributions are welcome. Feeling low? send in a pull request :)
